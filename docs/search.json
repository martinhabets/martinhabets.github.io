My findings rule out that this association is entirely driven by changes in the reporting behavior of victims. I find that the association between temperature and domestic violence is stronger for domestic violence than for other types of crime: Higher temperatures, by increasing irritability and victimization risk, lead to more domestic violence incidents. My results show a differential impact of temperature even over small geographies within the city. I document a large heterogeneity across neighborhoods, and show that the impact of temperature is strongly correlated to neighborhood characteristics such as poverty and housing attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of Siblings in Gender Norms Formation (with Libertad González)\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: Siblings are key players in children’s network. As siblings grow up together, they interact daily and serve as sources of social support and role models for one another. During a time when they are forming their own identities, the presence of a sister (as opposed to a brother) is thus likely to impact the formation of their gender norms. In this project, I examine the role of sibling gender in contributing to the formation of gender norms, for a very recent cohort of children, aged 12-14, using data from an experiment by Farré et al. (2021)."
