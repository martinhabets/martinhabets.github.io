I find a positive, contemporaneous, and linear relationship between daily temperature and domestic violence in a context characterized by mild climatic conditions. On average, a 1°C increase in daily temperature is associated with a 2.7% increase in domestic violence – a response larger than that observed for other types of crime. My findings rule out that changes in victims’ reporting behavior entirely drive the relationship. Leveraging census data in close to 2,000 neighborhoods, I document an unequal response of domestic violence to temperature along urban poverty levels.\n\nPresented at: Maastricht Workshop on Applied Economics of the Environment (2024), 6th QMUL Economics and Finance Workshop (2024), Tor Vergata Ph.D. Conference (2024)\n\n  Download Paper    Code and website \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of Siblings in Gender Norms Formation\n\n\n\n\n\n(with Libertad González)\nAbstract: Siblings are key players in children’s network. As siblings grow up together, they interact daily and serve as sources of social support and role models for one another. During a time when they are forming their own identities, the presence of a sister (as opposed to a brother) is thus likely to impact the formation of their gender norms. In this project, I examine the role of sibling gender in contributing to the formation of gender norms, for a very recent cohort of children, aged 12-14, using data from an experiment by Farré et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloom and Bust: The Impact of Pollen on Workplace Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n(with Benjamin Hattemer and Ismael Moreno-Martinez)"
